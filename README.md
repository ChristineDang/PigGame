Players take turn rolling the dice and the numbers roll adds up to the player's current score. If a player rolls a one, they lose all of their current score and the turn goes to the next player. Players have the option to hold their score, which adds their current score to their total score, and transfers the turn to the next player. The player that reaches one hundred points first, wins the game.
